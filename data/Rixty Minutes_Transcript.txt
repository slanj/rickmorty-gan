Int. Smith Residence. The Smith Family and Rick are sitting in the living room watching TV. 
Bachelor (on TV): Cynthia...
Jerry: Oh, my God! No, no..!
Summer: I told you!
Beth: Hold on.
Bachelor (on TV): Will you please... NOT marry me-- I choose Veronica.
Summer: What?
Jerry: Yes!
Beth: Called it.
Summer: Why would he choose Veronica?
Jerry: Because he loves her?
Rick: Well if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid.
Jerry: Okay, I've got an idea, Rick: you show us your concept of "good TV", and we'll crap all over that.
Rick : [stands, walking to the TV] I thought you'd never ask.
[disconnects and drops cable box, which breaks upon impact to the floor]
Jerry: Hey!
Morty: Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions.
Rick: [working on the cable box] 20% accurate, as usual, [snatching the remote from Morty] Morty. [reconnecting the cable box as the TV buffers] The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality.
Jerry: Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme?
Rick: How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn? [turns on TV]
Corn Man 1 (on TV): We're not so different. We're both corn of action.
Corn Man 2 (on TV): Yeah... But one of us is dead corn! [shoots Corn Man 1]
Summer: Boring.
Rick: Summer, [belch] you just spent [belch] three months watching a man choose a fake wife.
Jerry: So, what, It'd be better if the people were corn?
Rick: Jerry, you don't get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look. [changes channel]
Glenn (on TV): This shit is delicious.
Rick: A movie about a guy eating shit. [changes channel, various people are fighting on TV] A violent Antiques Show... [changes channel]
Letterman (on TV): It's a pleasure to have you.
Jerry (on TV): The pleasure's all mine.
Rick: Letterman from a time line where Jerry's famous. [changes channel]
Jerry: Wait!
Beth: What in the hell?
Rick: I agree. Where's this going?
Jerry: No, the other thing! Go back!
Rick: Really? All right, fine.
Woman (on TV): Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can't eat shit anymore.
Rick: All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked.
Int. Smith Residence. The Smith Family and Rick are sitting in the living room watching TV.
Announcer (on TV): Coming up next on "Shmloo's the Shmloss", Shmlony has a nightmare.
Shmlony (on TV): Shmlantha, Schmlona!
Rick: Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with "Schmla".
Shmlony (on TV): Schmlove, Schmlandula, Schmlonathan--
Rick: All right, that got that actually got old pretty quick.
Jerry: [sighs] Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman?
Rick [flipping through the channels]: Infinity's a big number, Jerry. I don't remember the channel.
Beth: Go back, go back!
Rick: Jeez. [changes channel]
Jerry (on TV): You speak da tru-tru.
Summer: Oh my God! Dad's in "Cloud Atlas"!
Jerry: I'm in "Cloud Atlas"! What's "Cloud Atlas"?
Jerry (on TV): Sometimes small tru-tru different than da big tru-tru.
Beth: How is this possible?
Rick: Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities. Including a time line where Jerry's a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Ju-- Wa-- Look at this. [changes channel]
Host in Trenchcoat (on TV): And now, another Quick Mystery.
Cop (on TV): I just want to know who could've done something like this. It's a travesty!
Killer 1 (on TV): I did. See this knife and all the blood on it? Here's my fingerprints.
Judge (on TV): Guilty! I sentence you to life in prison.
[Killer 1 is thrown in jail]
Host in Trenchcoat (on TV): Here's another Quick Mystery.
Man (on TV): My mother's dead!
Killer 2 (on TV): And I killed her. Here's the weapon. And cuff me, thank you very much.
Judge (on TV): Guilty! Sentenced to murder.
[Killer 2 is killed via electric chair]
Host in Trenchcoat (on TV): Here's anothe--
Killer 3 (on TV): I'm the killer! [puts gun in mouth, firing it once offscreen]
Host in Trenchcoat (on TV): Wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it?
Rick: Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?
Beth, Summer, and Jerry [all at once]: Narcissism.
The narcisstic stuff.
I want to obsess about myself.
Rick: [sighs] Here.
[stands, pulling an ocular device from his coat] These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. 
[throws the device into the kitchen] Go fetch!
[Jerry, Summer, and Beth run to the kitchen]
Beth and Summer [at the same time]Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First!
Rick: I'm proud of you, Morty.
Morty: Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!
Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson (on TV): I'm Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson, Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson's Electronics. I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! And there's so many TVs, microwaves, radios I think, I can't-- I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything. Our prices, I hope, aren't too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That's fair! I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson! Everything's black, I can't see a thing!
[set on fire] And also I can't feel anything either-- did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can't feel. It's a very rare disease. All my-- All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch. So I never know what's going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know.
